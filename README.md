This README file contains the directory layout and replication steps to replicate the results found in "results_wfh_ssi.pdf". In partiuclar, I examine the relationship between WFH and Supplemental Security Income for workers with disabilities. If there are any questions or concerns please email me: octaviomaguilar@outlook.com

Replication instructions:
- The only data that must be downloaded by you is the raw IPUMS data. Instructions on how to download the data and variables needed can be found in "data/ipums/raw".
- Once the raw data from IPUMS is downloaded you will have all the data needed to run the cleaning process and analysis.
- In each program, you will find that I have set the global directory ``home'' to be my local computer. If you keep the folder stucture the same, the only thing you must do is modify this home directory to match your system.
- After changing the directory, please start by running all the programs in the clean folder. They are label from step 1 to step 11. After running each program in the clean folder, you are able to run any program in the analysis folder.
