This README file contains the directory layout and replication steps to replicate the results found in "results_wfh_ssi.pdf". In particular, I examine the relationship between WFH and Supplemental Security Income for workers with disabilities. If there are any questions or concerns please email me: octaviomaguilar@outlook.com

Replication instructions:
- The only data that must be downloaded by you is the raw IPUMS data. Instructions on how to download can be found in the document "download instructions" found in "data/ipums/raw".
- Once the raw data from IPUMS is downloaded you will have all the data needed to run the cleaning process and analysis.
- In each program, you will find that I have set the global directory ''home'' to be my local computer. If you keep the folder stucture the same, the only thing you must do is modify this home directory to match your system.
- After changing the directory, please start by running all the programs in the clean folder. They are labeled from step 1 to 11. After running each program in the clean folder, you are then able to run any program in the analysis folder.
