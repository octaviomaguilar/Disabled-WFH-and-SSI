There is nothing in the raw IPUMS folder. The raw data is too large to keep in this repository. 

1.) Pull the following variables from the IPUMS CPS-ASEC from 2017 to 2024: 
year serial month hwtfinl cpsid asecflag asecwth pernum wtfinl cpsidv cpsidp 
asecwt inctot incwage incss incssi incvet incsurv incdisab incdivid incrent 
incasist srcdisa1 srcdisa2 incdisa1 incdisa2 whyss1 whyss2 gotvdisa disabwrk

once you have unzipped the file in the ipums folder name the Stata data file as: "raw_cps_asec.dta"

once you have unzipped the file in the ipums folder name the Stata data file as: "raw_acs.dta" and 
make another copy and save it as "raw_acs_ssi.dta".

Once you do this, you will have all the raw data files needed to replicate the analysis.
